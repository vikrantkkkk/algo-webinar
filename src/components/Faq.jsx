    id: 3,
    question: "How does back testing and forward testing work?",
    answer:
      "Back testing is a process where you can simulate your strategy performance using historical market data to judge its performance, and adjust your strategy parameters, if required. Forward testing on the other hand is a process where you can live test your strategy in real time market conditions to verify the success rate of any given strategy without using real funds - you're basically paper trading the strategy before going live.",

  {
    id: 7,
    question: "Can I manually close the positions executed by the algo?",
    answer:
      "Yes you can, however you will need to stop the live deployment from your dashboard before closing the position manually, since the system will still punch an order to close your position when an exit signal such as target hit or stop loss is met. Hence, we recommend you to first stop or pause the live deployment and then intervene manually.",
